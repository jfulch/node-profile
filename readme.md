Getting Started
To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:
`node server.js`

This will start the server on port 3000. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.

If you encounter any issues, make sure that you have installed all of the required dependencies by running the following command:
`npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
